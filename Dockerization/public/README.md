# Public

This folder contains static assets for the HappyStreak web application, including CSS, JavaScript, and images. These files are served directly to the client to handle the frontend of the application.

## What to Add:
- **CSS**: Stylesheets for the application's frontend. Organize the styles by page, component, or feature.
  - Example: `styles.css`, `dashboard.css`, `challenge.css`
  - Use consistent naming conventions for styles and keep the CSS modular.
  
- **Images**: All image files used in the application (e.g., icons, logos, banners, etc.).
  - Organize images into subfolders for better management (e.g., `/icons`, `/logos`, `/backgrounds`).
  - Ensure images are optimized for performance (use formats such as `.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`).

- **JavaScript**: Any frontend JavaScript files required for interactivity or handling client-side logic.
  - Organize JavaScript files by feature or page (e.g., `home.js`, `profile.js`, `challenge.js`).
  - Where necessary, integrate with backend data using API calls (e.g., using `fetch`).
